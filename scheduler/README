## Versions
### V1
Initial version which outputs a daily schedule (i.e. it doesn't support shifts after midnight).
The implemented constraints are:
- Shift duration
- Number of drivers (same as number of vehicles?)
- A driver can only be assigned to one shift per day
- The sum of assigned time must be at least of the shift duration
- The assigned shift slots must be consecutive
- Minimum shifts per hour
- Max amount of shifts that can start/end per minute slot
- Don't end during rush hours
