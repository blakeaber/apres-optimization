## Versions
### V1
Initial version which outputs a daily schedule (i.e. it doesn't support shifts after midnight).
The implemented constraints are:
- Shift duration
- Number of drivers (same as number of vehicles?)
- A driver can only be assigned to one shift per day
- The sum of assigned time must be at least of the shift duration
- The assigned shift slots must be consecutive
- Minimum shifts per hour
- Max amount of shifts that can start/end per minute slot
- Don't end during rush hours

### V6
Completely refactored code into separate directories and modules (for separation of concerns).
The modules are:
- `auxiliary.py`: defining auxiliary variables and KPIs used by the optimizer
- `utils.py`: stores the SolutionCollector and other utility functions for the solver / app
The directories are:
- `constraints`: defining all constraints as functions to be referenced by the solver
- `solutions`: a folder containing all possible solutions (in order) as the solver identifies them
- `user_input`: a place for the inputs / parameters to be stored
- `user_output`: a folder containing the optimal output of the solver
